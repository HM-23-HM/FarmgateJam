# FarmgateJam
Data analysis web application for Jamaican Farmgate prices

The data was received in the following tabular format once a week.

Every spreadsheet was a standalone, and this made perforning simple data analysis cumbersome.
This spurred me to create a script with Python to automatically extract the data from the Excel sheets and store them in a MySQL database.
I initially created a web app with Dash (Plotly), but I wanted greater control over the looks and feel of the web page so I created a web app from scratch.
